# Advices for first start

- Create 2 users with the sign up page
- Sign in with one of the 2 users and give him admin and author permissions in the database (set the `is_admin` and `is_author` to `true` in the `users` table)
- Don't modify the permission of your admin user in the dashboard, you won't be able to access the dashboard anymore. And as the permissions of your token are not like the permissions in the database, your token won't be considered as valid so you will have to sign in again.
